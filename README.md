# S.O.B. (Signal Operations Board)
The Signal Operations Board (S.O.B.) is a custom STM32F4 PCB designed as a project to learn electronics design, digital signal processing, and control theory algorithms. The board is complete with an IMU, barometric pressure sensor, flash memory, and serial wire debug implemented using I2C and SPI. The MCU runs using FreeRTOS.
